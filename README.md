# BeltLineNet: Real-time Circular Conveyor Belt Deviation Detection

## ðŸŽ¯ Introduction

Detecting deviation in circular pipe conveyors is essential for preventing material spillage, environmental contamination, and ensuring operational efficiency.

This repository introduces our work "*BeltLineNet: A Lightweight Real-time Network for Circular Conveyor Belt Deviation Detection*". 

Two demonstration videos have been uploaded for intuitive comparison:

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset: Circular pipe Conveyor belt line Deviation Dataset (CCDD)

Due to the absence of publicly available datasets specifically targeting circular pipe conveyor deviation detection, we introduce the **Circular pipe Conveyor belt line Deviation Dataset (CCDD)**, explicitly tailored for detecting critical conveyor componentsâ€”rollers and belt linesâ€”under realistic industrial scenarios.

### ðŸ“Œ Dataset Overview

- **Data Source:** Authentic, unaugmented images captured directly from operational industrial environments.
- **Acquisition Method:** Images manually captured by personnel mimicking the inspection robot's trajectory and perspectives.
- **Dataset Characteristics:**
  - Realistic inspection scenarios: slight camera shaking, minor motion blur, varied yet typical viewpoints, and visual occlusions.
  - Diverse industrial sites: coal mines, docks, chemical plants, ensuring dataset robustness and practical relevance.

### ðŸ“Œ Dataset Composition

- **Total Instances:**
  - Rollers: **4,201**
  - Belt Lines: **1,025**
- **Annotations Format:** Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) annotations provided.

### ðŸ“Œ Availability and Access

The CCDD dataset, including images and OBB annotations, is publicly available at:

ðŸ“‹ [Zenodo Repository - CCDD Dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15094230)

Original source videos used to create the dataset are also included in this repository.
